/*
Leetcode Problem 11: Container With Most Water
----------------------------------------------
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn 
such that the two endpoints of the i-th line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Approach (Two Pointers):
------------------------
- Initialize two pointers: left at 0 and right at n-1.
- Compute the area between left and right â†’ area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left).
- Update max area if current area is greater.
- Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward (since a taller line may give more area).
- Repeat until left >= right.

Time Complexity:  O(n)   (each pointer moves at most n steps)
Space Complexity: O(1)   (constant extra space)
